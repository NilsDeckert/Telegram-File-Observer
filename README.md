# Telegram-File-Observer
This Telegram bot periodically checks if the PDF of a given link has been updated. If so, the bot sends the updated file to
all of the bot's users who subscribed to the newsletter and logs the time and date of the update in a database. Users are also able to subscribe to a certain string and only receive a message if that string is contained in the PDF.
